Shizzle - Online Multiplayer Word game

TO RUN APPLICATION: Make sure you compile it first. It is advisable that you use Netbeans IDE. This program was compiled using netbeans IDE. Dependencies are located in the 'safe folder'. Copy and paste in the 'dist' folder anytime you recompile (clean build) the project JAR file using netbean IDE. Source code looks for dependencies where the JAR file is located, not where class file is located. This is the dist folder. If you run the program through netbeans without compiling (build) it first, it will not be able to find some of the dependencies. It will run nonetheless. 

I wrote this program when I was newbie to Java. It needs to be reimplemented using the CardLayout technique. The file load system works only with windows. It needs to be optimized to work on other operating system.
